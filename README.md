# Terraform Provider Artifactory #
## Using the provider ##

If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to [install it as a plugin.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin) After placing it into your plugins directory,  run `terraform init` to initialize it.

## Requirements ##
-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.9 (to build the provider plugin)
-   [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep/releases) 0.3.2 (for dependency management)


## Building The Provider ##

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/atlassian/terraform-provider-artifactory`

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/atlassian/terraform-provider-artifactory
go build
```

To install the provider
```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/atlassian/terraform-provider-artifactory
go install
```

## Roadmap ##

This library is being initially developed for an internal application at
Atlassian, so resources will likely be implemented in the order that they are
needed. Eventually, it would be ideal to cover the entire Artifactory API, so 
contributions are of course always welcome. The calling pattern is pretty well 
established, so adding new methods is relatively straightforward.

## Versioning ##

In general, this project follows [semver](https://semver.org/) as closely as we
can for tagging releases of the package. We've adopted the following versioning policy:

	functionality, including changes to the exported Go API surface
	or behavior of the API.
* We increment the **minor version** with any backwards-compatible changes to
	functionality.
* We increment the **patch version** with any backwards-compatible bug fixes.
