# Artifactory Provider

The [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) provider is used to interact with the
resources supported by Artifactory. The provider needs to be configured
with the proper credentials before it can be used.

- Available Resources
    * [Groups](./r/artifactory_group.html.markdown)
    * [Users](./r/artifactory_user.html.markdown)
    * [Permission Target](./r/artifactory_permission_target.html.markdown)
    * [Local Repositories](./r/artifactory_local_repository.html.markdown)
    * [Remote Repositories](./r/artifactory_remote_repository.html.markdown)
    * [Replication Configurations](./r/artifactory_replication_config.html.markdown)
    * [Single Replication Configurations](./r/artifactory_single_replication_config.html.markdown)
    * [Virtual Repositories](./r/artifactory_virtual_repository.html.markdown)

- Deprecated Resources
    * [Permission Targets (V1 API)](./r/artifactory_permission_target_v1.html.markdown)

## Example Usage
```hcl
# Configure the Artifactory provider
provider "artifactory" {
  url = "${var.artifactory_url}"
  username = "${var.artifactory_username}"
  password = "${var.artifactory_password}"
}

# Create a new repository
resource "artifactory_local_repository" "pypi-libs" {
  key             = "pypi-libs"
  package_type    = "pypi"
  repo_layout_ref = "simple-default"
  description     = "A pypi repository for python packages"
}
```

## Authentication
The Artifactory provider supports multiple means of authentication. The following methods are supported:
    * Basic Auth
    * Bearer Token
    * JFrog API Key Header
    * Unix socket

### Basic Auth
Basic auth may be used by adding a `username` and `password` field to the provider block
Getting this value from the environment is supported with the `ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME` and `ARITFACTORY_PASSWORD` variable

Usage:
```hcl
# Configure the Artifactory provider
provider "artifactory" {
  url = "artifactory.site.com"
  username = "myusername"
  password = "mypassword"
}
```

### Bearer Token
Artifactory access tokens may be used via the Authorization header by providing the `access_token` field to the provider
block. Getting this value from the environment is supported with the `ARTIFACTORY_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable

Usage:
```hcl
# Configure the Artifactory provider
provider "artifactory" {
  url = "artifactory.site.com"
  access_token = "abc...xy"
}
```

### JFrog API Key Header
Artifactory API keys may be used via the `X-JFrog-Art-Api` header by providing the `api_key` field in the provider block.
Getting this value from the environment is supported with the `ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY` variable

Usage:
```hcl
# Configure the Artifactory provider
provider "artifactory" {
  url = "artifactory.site.com"
  api_key = "abc...xy"
}
```

### Unix socket
Authentication added by proxy listening to unix socket.

Usage:
```hcl
# Configure the Artifactory provider
provider "artifactory" {
  url = "artifactory.site.com"
  unix_socket = "~/.authproxy"
}
```


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `url` - (Required) URL of Artifactory. This can also be sourced from the `ARTIFACTORY_URL` environment variable.
* `username` - (Optional) Username for basic auth. Requires `password` to be set. 
    Conflicts with `api_key`, and `access_token`. This can also be sourced from the `ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME` environment variable.
* `password` - (Optional) Password for basic auth. Requires `username` to be set. 
    Conflicts with `api_key`, and `access_token`. This can also be sourced from the `ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD` environment variable.
* `api_key` - (Optional) API key for api auth. Uses `X-JFrog-Art-Api` header. 
    Conflicts with `username`, `password`, and `access_token`. This can also be sourced from the `ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY` environment variable.
* `access_token` - (Optional) API key for token auth. Uses `Authorization: Bearer` header. 
    Conflicts with `username` and `password`, and `api_key`. This can also be sourced from the `ARTIFACTORY_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
* `unix_socket` - (Optional) Path to unix socket opened by authenticating proxy.
    Conflicts with `username` and `password`, `api_key`, and `access_token`. This can also be sourced from the `ARTIFACTORY_UNIX_SOCKET` environment variable.
